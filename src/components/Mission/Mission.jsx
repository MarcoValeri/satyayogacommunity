                <p className="mission__content p">The Bhagavad Gita teaches us that "Yoga is the journey of the self, through the self, to the self", but it is not a journey we have to take on our own! Our mission is to create a space within our busy London where yoga students and teachers are supported and connected. Satya Yoga is more than a studio; it's a community hub.</p>
